## Hi there :wave:

[Words Tell Art](https://wordstell.art) 🌠 an innovative NFT collection using AI for its burn to redeem mechanism, is completed and now live on mainnet.
<br/>
<br/>
👋 Currently working on a brand new project on [ImmutableX](https://docs.x.immutable.com/reference/), it is a community dashboard that packup every IMX functionalities and offer a great entry-point for newbies and developers on IMX. Create you collections and mint NFTs using a proper UI on [IMX Dashboard](https://imx.dlab.ovh/).

<br/>
In the backstage i am working on a new decentralized game distribution [platform](https://github.com/padium) :video_game: with a simple purpose, give back ownership to players on the titles they purchase.
I am also building a fully on-chain multiplayer strategy [game](https://github.com/Draym/blackhole-evm) where players will build their armies of creature before conquering the whole blockchain :space_invader::collision:.
